The dataset includes 4 dataframes: `bakers`, `ratings`, `challenges`, and `episodes`. `bakers` has 120 rows, each representing an individual baker, and 24 columns. `ratings` has 94 rows, each representing an episode, and 11 variables, including ratings and the original airdates in the US and the UK. `challenges` has details about the three types of challenges (signature, technical, and showstopper) as well as the performance of each baker (star baker, eliminated). It has 1136 rows, each representing a baker per episode, and 7 variables. As for `episodes`, it has 94 rows and 10 variables. Each row represents an episode and the variables describe different attributes of the episode like the number of bakers that appeared in it and the name of eliminated bakers. The variables we plan on using are: `episodes_appeared`, `bottom_three`, `top_three`, `season`, `age`, `viewers_7day`, `viewers_28day`, `uk_airdate`, and `bakers_out`.\n\nWe were initially interested in the data set because so many of us enjoyed watching the British and French versions of the show, but our main deciding factor was the fact that the data set has such a vast array of both categorical and numerical variables.\n\n# Questions\n\n## Question 1\n\nThe first question we want to address is \"How does the number of times that a baker appears in weekly bottom 3 scores correlate to the number of total episodes they appear in?\"\n\n## Question 2\n\nThe second question we want to explore is \"By season, how does the number of bakers eliminated correlate to the viewership of the episode?\"\n\n# Analysis plan\n\n## Question 1\n\nWe plan on creating a new variable called `age_generation` by subtracting the contestants' age at the time of competition from the show's original air date to find each contestant's birth year. We will then use the birth year to group each contestant by their generation and plot their ages using a discrete color scale. We will be finding the generational divides using the years given by [weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/09/how-different-age-groups-identify-with-their-generational-labels/). We will also plot `episodes_appeared` on the x-axis and `bottom_three` on the y-axis using a scatter plot. We will then add a trend line in order to see the relationship between the two. Finally, we will facet to differentiate between seasons.\n\n## Question 2\n\nIn order to compare the viewership distribution for each potential number of bakers eliminated (either zero, one, or two), we will plot vertical box plots of both the 7-day and 28-day viewership (distinguishing them by color) for each number of bakers eliminated. This format will allow us to compare how viewership may vary between the two timespan calculations and between the different numbers of bakers eliminated. Finally, these graphs will also be faceted by season.\n",
